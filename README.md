## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Data Input:** A healthcare provider inputs multi-faceted patient data through the secure web interface, including EHR records, vital signs, and medical images.
2.  **AI Processing:** The backend, powered by a sophisticated AI model, processes this complex data. It runs predictive algorithms, survival analysis models, and fairness checks simultaneously.
3.  **Insight Generation:** The system generates a comprehensive report containing:
    -   A primary risk prediction score and explanation.
    -   A survival probability chart over time.
    -   A fairness analysis to check for demographic bias.
    -   A set of actionable clinical recommendations.
4.  **Visualization:** The results are sent back to the frontend and displayed on a clean, interactive dashboard for easy interpretation.
